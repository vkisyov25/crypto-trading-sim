- **Reset** their account at any time

## Tech Stack

---

### Frontend
- **HTML** ‚Äì Defines the structure and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS** ‚Äì Handles the visual styling and layout of the user interface.
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Implements the client-side logic, including WebSocket handling, buying/selling, and dynamic DOM updates.
- **Fetch API** ‚Äì Used to perform HTTP requests to the backend for actions like fetching assets, balances, and transactions.

---

### Backend
- **Java** ‚Äì The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot** ‚Äì Powers the REST APIs and manages the application's business logic, request handling, and database interactions. Organized in layers (Controller, Service, DAO) for maintainability.

---

### API Source
- **Kraken WebSocket API v2** ‚Äì Provides real-time data for cryptocurrency prices, including buy and sell values for the top 20 cryptocurrencies.

---

### Database
- **MySQL** ‚Äì Stores all persistent data including:
  - Registered users and their account balances
  - User-owned cryptocurrency assets
  - Complete transaction history (BUY/SELL)
- **SQL Script** ‚Äì Used to create the necessary schema without relying on any ORM tools.


## Features

### Real-time Price Display
The application connects to the Kraken WebSocket API to receive live market updates. A dynamically updating table displays each cryptocurrency‚Äôs symbol, current buy price (ask), and sell price (bid), ensuring users see the most recent values in real time.

### Virtual Account
Every user starts with a virtual balance of $10,000. When a cryptocurrency is purchased, the cost is automatically deducted from this balance. Selling crypto increases the balance accordingly. The system prevents invalid transactions such as trying to buy more than the available balance or selling more than owned.

### Transactions
All BUY and SELL operations are saved in the database. The application keeps a full transaction history for each user, including the transaction type, symbol, price, quantity, timestamp, and calculated profit or loss when applicable.

### Reset Account
Users can reset their account at any time. This action restores the balance to the initial $10,000, removes all currently held assets, and deletes the transaction history ‚Äî providing a clean slate for new simulations.
